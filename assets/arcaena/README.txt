The 'arcaena' folder contains all of the files that will be needed for Arcaena. They do not do anything in vanilla Minecraft.

If you are working on an item and there is not yet a texture in this folder, then it won't have a model either (although it might have a language identifier). If you need a specific texture at a specific time, I can make one.
