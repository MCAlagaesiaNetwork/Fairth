The 'arcaena' folder contains all of the files that will be needed for Arcaena. They do not do anything in vanilla Minecraft.

If you are working on an item and there is not yet a texture in this folder, then just ask and I'll make one.

--------------------

The following blocks need to be converted to their own blocks in Arcaena when development starts. At the moment, they replace Minecraft blocks.

- Redstone Torch -> Burnt-out Torch
- Red Sandstone Slab -> Path Block Slab, Dirt Slab, Coarse Dirt Slab, Gravel Slab
- Shulker Boxes -> Crates
- Daylight Sensor -> Stack of Books
- Redstone Dust -> Bloodstains
- Creeper Banner Pattern -> Arcaena Logo Banner Pattern (maybe? This would be harder to swap out, as you can't do it with commands)

--------------------

The 'arcaena' folder also contains assets for the following unique Arcaena blocks and items, which will also need to be added.

Blocks:

- Pedestal
- Framed Glass
- Framed Glass Pane
- Gold Bricks

Items:

- Bandage Roll
- Dragon Egg (different colours)
- Eldunar√≠ (different colours)
- Gold Coin
