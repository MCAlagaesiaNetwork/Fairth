The 'arcaena' folder contains all of the files that will be needed for Arcaena. They do not do anything in vanilla Minecraft.

If you are working on an item and there is not yet a texture in this folder, then just ask and I'll make one.

Bear in mind that the following blocks need to be converted to their own item in Arcaena when development starts. At the moment, they replace Minecraft blocks.

- Redstone Torch -> Burnt-out Torch
- Red Sandstone Slab -> Path Block Slab, Dirt Slab, Coarse Dirt Slab, Gravel Slab
- Shulker Boxes -> Crates (maybe this one isn't necessary)
